# Bleem

Bleem will by a fantasy but serious computer. It's a simple 32-bit RISC machine.
It borrows concepts from retro computers like the Commodore64 and more modern aproaches like the Oberon RISC computer among others.

It eventually will have a default high level programming language that's a mix between Oberon-07, BASIC and Megezeux Robotic (no, it's not a joke ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯).
